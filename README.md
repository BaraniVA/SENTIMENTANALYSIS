# SENTIMENTANALYSIS
Sentiment Analysis using NLTK
This project demonstrates how to use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to analyze the sentiment of a given sentence.

Requirements

Python 3

NLTK library

Installation

Clone or download this repository.

Install the NLTK library by running pip install nltk in your command line.

Download the necessary NLTK resources by running nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

Usage

Run the script sentiment_analysis.py

The script will test some sample sentences and will output the sentiment of each sentence on a scale of -1 to 1, where -1 is negative, 0 is neutral, and 1 is positive.

Customization

You can customize the script by changing the sample sentences or by using it to analyze other text sources, such as tweets or reviews.

Note

This is a simple project to understand the basics of NLP and Sentiment analysis, you can also use this to further train the model to analyze the sentiment of a text.

You can use this as a base for a more complex AI project, for example by using it to analyze tweets or reviews of a product, or to train a model to classify text based on sentiment
